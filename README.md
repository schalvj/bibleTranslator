## Project Submission
  - Upload a zip file of the entire project to Canvas
  - Provide the Github URL link to the repository in the comment section

## Project Requirements
Your application will need to make use of the following resources:
  - ### JSoup - Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

The user will also have a text area to take notes with.
  - ### JDBC API and Streams - Java API that can access any kind of tabular data, especially data stored in a Relational Database. JDBC works with Java on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
